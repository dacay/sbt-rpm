This is a simple helloworld web archive (war) project.

That illustrates the use of maven rpm plugin to build a 
simple automated deployment with RPM and puppet.

The basic things like register yum repo and install the helloworld rpm
from that repo is done by puppet. The dependencies of the helloworld rpm
like java and tomcat are managed by the rpm specification in the pom.xml
file with the maven rpm plugin. 

This is a minimal puppet approach the rpm dependencies could also be managed
by puppet.

Required:
 - rpm (is needed to build a rom with maven and deploy it to the local yum repo -> install with apt-get install rpm)
 - vagrant (optional to test the puppet deployment -> install with apt-get install vagrant)
 - puppet (is only needed in the vagrant box and is prepared in the configured base box)
 - CentOS64_201307 (self created base box at the moment have problems to publish it in git or else were hopefully is fixed in some days)
 

Let's start.

1) clone this repository
2) download base box for vagrant (could take some minutes the first time, if the download was 
   successfull it is stored local) do it only one time
   $ vagrant box add CentOS64_201307 https://raw.github.com/pussinboots/basebox/master/CentOS64_201307
3) $ vagrant up
4) $ vagrant ssh
5) (ssh on helloworld machine)
   $ wget localhost:8080/helloworld
   >result should be
   <html><body>Hello World from rpm package</body></html>
6) (ssh on apache machine)
   $ wget localhost
   >result should be
   <h1>Hello from a Vagrant VM</h1>
   

The helloworld vm will be setup with ip address 192.168.1.10 and the helloworld app can also be
requested with http://192.168.1.10:8080/helloworld.

The apache vm will be setup with ip address 192.168.1.11 and the index.html file can also be
requested with http://192.168.1.11.

You can change the ip address in the Vagrant file see web_config.vm.network :hostonly, "192.168.1.10" or
apache_config.vm.network :hostonly, "192.168.1.11".

Enyoj playing around with it.

The missing part of that is how you can deploy new version of helloworld and or index.html file. 
I will explain it in some days it is really simple.
